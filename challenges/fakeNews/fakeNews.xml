        <p>FakeNews is a portal that is known for publishing interesting facts and celebrity news, but
            more recently some under pseudonym <strong>M.P.</strong> has published some rather shocking news.</p>

        <p>The target of these scandalous headlines is Mr. X, known in some circles as a person with questionable
            reputation. Mr. X will reward you with a hefty sum, if you somehow manage to discover who is behind initials <strong>M.P.</strong></p>

        <p>The job shouldn't be that hard, because the developer of the FakeNews didn't care enough about protecting the
        website from SQL injection attacks. When you find out the real name of <strong>M.P.</strong>, send his full name
        using his own email on their contact page, to scare them away</p>

        <p>Good luck with your task! Remember, a nice prize is waiting for you!</p>
